This is definitely how I like to do stuff.

This project is a simple server-client application with CRUD methods exposed through rest apis.
It's actually called "spec03" because it's based on jakarta 3 specifications (ws-rs, jpa).
It runs on Tomcat 10 servlet container.

Things I used:

Backend:
Java 11
Jakarta WS RS 3.0
Jersey Implementation 3.0
Jakarta Persistence 3.0
EclipseLink 3.0
MySQL 8.0
Tomcat 10.0

Frontend:
JavaScript
HTML
CSS

Long live Java-JavaScript friendship
